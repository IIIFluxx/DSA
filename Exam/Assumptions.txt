- The assignment specification only specifies that the first question be *thoroughly tested*, and so whilst I've tested everything in all harnesses,
	I've only implemented "a score at the end to indicate tests passed out of the total tested" for the Trees question (Q1) only.


- Assumed that the displayAsMatrix() method only works (well) with single-digit/character values as headers (on the axis titles). I've attempted to pad spaces.
