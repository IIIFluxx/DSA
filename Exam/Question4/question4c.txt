Q: Based on the output from parts a) and b), and your knowledge of collision handling, discuss the differences between the two strategies.
==========================
==========================

Clusters can form in linear probing, which is where quadratic probing is advantageous, as it works by taking the hash index and probing to a wider area
by probing 'quadratically' (separates cells at a wider gap, so we skip regions in the table), instead of those adjacent to an existing hash site, 
and the probe works until an empty region is found.

But this leads to a different type of clustering called 'Secondary Clustering', which is something that Double Hashing avoids completely. 
This happens because the quadratic probing algorithm uses the same steps each time - it has quadratic growth in steps and hence we go from 1 to 4 to 9 to 16 etc.
Another issue of Quadratic Probing that Double Hashing avoids, is that if the table fills up, it may struggle to find free remaining spots for the hash index. 

Double Hashing uses the approach of applying a second hash function to the key when a collision occurs. 
Thus the hash index is determined by the second hash function. The probe sequence is determined dependent on the key itself, instead of it being repeated for every key. 
This leads to different keys having different probing sequences, which eradicates any issue of primary or secondary clusters. 

- Because of this, given the table size is prime, double hashing will always find a free spot.

- Double Hashing does not result in any primary or secondary clustering, whereas Quadratic Probing is prone to Secondary clusters (but *greatly* reduces Primary clusters)

- However, due to there being two hash functions needing to be computed, Double Hashing experiences more computational time.
